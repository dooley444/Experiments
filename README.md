The idea with this project is to create a simple game where the player is guided through a series of binary choices. The point of this exercise is for me to get used to creating if, else, and elif statement. Still a work in progress. The next level of development would be freshen up the actual presentation of the text so that it is all spaced out and easy to read, and also at one point down the line transition it to a game with actual visuals, and/or to allow for the user to choose from a variety of choices. For example, to make a version of this on the level of the game "Zorg", http://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq
